Make a program calledreplacethat takes a filename and two strings, let’s call thems1 and s2, that are NOT empty.It will open the file, and write its contents to FILENAME.replace, after replacingevery occurrence of s1 with s2.All the member functions of the class std::string are allowed, except replace.  Usethem wisely!Of course, you will handle errors as best you can. Do not use the C file manipulationfunctions, because that would be cheating, and cheating’s bad, m’kay?You will turn in some test files to show your program works.
